## Key Functionalities

- Collection Cateogories

## Key Components

- Homepage 
- The Collection Page provides the user with categories like summer collection, winter collection, or spring collection. If the user clicks on any collection, that click will take them to the page containing items in that category. If the user clicks on any item specifically, then another page will appear that contains the details of that specific item.

## Future Scope

In the future, I have planned to expand it to the backend by adding:
- Database functionality to store users and items data
